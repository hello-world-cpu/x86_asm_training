DATA REGISTERS:

EAX:
1: sys_exit system call
3: sys_read system call
4: sys_write system call

EBX:
n: exit status is n (0 means no error)
1: stdout file descriptor
2 (to check) stdin file descriptor (or stderr?)

ECX:
message (bytes to write)

EDX:
number of bytes to write (len equ $ - msg)

POINTER REGISTERS

EIP = instruction pointer
ESP = stack pointer
EBP = stack pointer (base pointer) used to backup ESP in functions

INDEX REGISTERS

ESI = source index
EDI = destination index

int 0x80: perform system call
